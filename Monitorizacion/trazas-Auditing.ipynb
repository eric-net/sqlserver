                "We are told that SQL Server 2008 R2 Audit (and SQL Server 2008 Audit) has much less performance overhead than SQL Trace when we try to capture the same information. Knowing how SQL Server R2 Audit is implemented (i.e. on top of the extended events infrastructure), I’ve always taken that as a given and never bothered to check it out.\n",
                "\n",
                "Recently, I had to capture some object access information, and it turned out that SQL Audit was not the most convenient tool for the task. I had to go back to SQL Trace. There, the question of how much cheaper is an audit relative to an equivalent trace came up. I thought it’s time to explore that a bit.\n",

                "The first question is the worst case scenario you probably should never run into. But it’s always good to know where the boundary is. The second question is a realistic and more common scenario.\n",

                "- **Heavy CPU load**. This was generated by 100 simulated users submitting the standard TPC-C readonly queries without any wait between any two consecutive calls. The total processor time on the 12-core (or 24-logical-processor) server was sustained at ~92%, and the transaction throughput (as measured by one of the TPC-C transactions) was steady at ~16,000 per second or about 32,000 batch requests per second on the SQL Server 2008 R2 instance.\n",
                "- **Medium CPU load**. This was generated by 100 simulated users submitting the standard TPC-C readonly queries with a 10ms wait between two consecutive calls. Compared to the previous load scenario, this otherwise rather small wait caused the total processor time on the server to sustain at a very low level at about 2%. In a way, it may be more appropriate to label this a light load level. But the sustained transaction throughput was about 3,100 per second or 6,200 batch requests per second, which still kept SQL Server busy looking up the pages.\n",

That was about 14% drop. Given how heavy the load was and how busy the traffic was on the server, that’s a relatively small drop. Now the impact of turning on the trace was quite a different story. There, the transaction throughput went from 16,043 per second to a mere 5,012 per second. That was a 60% drop. if we use 5012 as the base reference, turning off the trace increased the transaction throughput for more than 300%.

So the 14% drop in throughput is probably the ceiling, and you should probably expect much less an adverse impact by turning on a similar audit on a real production server. This next chart shows the result of turning on an audit (and separately a trace) when we don’t beat up the server with non-stop transaction traffic. As you can see, by just giving the server a little bit breathing room with a 10ms wait between the calls, the load on the server was reduced significantly and turning on either the audit or the trace had no impact at all on the throughput. Yes, the total CPU consumption went up a little bit as a result of turning on the audit or the trace, but the difference was rather insignificant.\n",
