Starting in SQL Server 2012, the Extended Events implementation provides comparable data collection capabilities to SQL Trace and can be used for comparisons of the overhead incurred by these two features. In this article we'll take a look at comparing the \"observer overhead\" that occurs when using SQL Trace and Extended Events in various configurations in order to determine the performance impact that data collection may have on our workload through the use of a replay workload capture and [Distributed Replay](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff878183.aspx).\n",

For systems running on SQL Server 2012, Extended Events provide the least amount of overhead and provide similar capabilities for events and columns as SQL Trace (some events in SQL Trace are rolled up into other events in Extended Events). Should SQL Trace be necessary for capturing event data – which may be the case until third-party tools are recoded to leverage Extended Events data – a server-side Trace to a file will yield the least amount of performance overhead. SQL Server Profiler is a tool to be avoided on busy production servers, as shown by the tenfold increase in duration and significant reduction in throughput for the replay.\n",
                "\n",
                "While the results would seem to favor running SQL Server Profiler remotely when Profiler must be used, this conclusion cannot be definitively drawn based on the specific tests that were run in this scenario. Additional testing and data collection would have to be performed to determine if the remote Profiler results were the result of lower context switching on the SQL Server instance, or if networking between VMs played a factor in the lower performance impact to the remote collection. The point in these tests was to show the significant overhead that Profiler incurs, regardless of where Profiler was being run. Finally, the live event stream in Extended Events also has a high overhead when it is actually connected in collecting data, but as shown in the tests, the Database Engine will disconnect a live stream if it falls behind on the events to prevent severely impacting the performance of the server."
